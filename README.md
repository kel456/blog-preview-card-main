### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- CSS Custom Properties: After I finished my last project, I noted that one aspect I wanted to work on was using CSS variables. For this project, I experimented with using them for the first time - it helped me define the color palette and reduce the need to type out the hsl codes each time I wanted to use a color.
- Flexbox: I realized that some parts of this project could benefit from using `display:flex`, such as the avatar/name (to vertically align) and the different parts of the card (to define gaps between items). This helped my spacing be more accurate (using `gap:` instead of playing around with margins and padding) and made components align the way I wanted.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue experimenting with Flexbox for future projects.
